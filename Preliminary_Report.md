 ## Abstract
 Create a text summarizer that can take a body of text, and summarize if the text contains a republican or democratic view. It can also conclude if the view is neurtral. This application uses NLP to achieve this. For the initial planning phase of this application, research will be conducted by the development
 team, to gain knowledge on NLP and applications similar to this this one. The theory that each programmer understands, will be tested when it comes time to implement this application. Various libraries will need to be researched, and each
 one considered for the application should be useful in their own way. Each programmer will have various tasks assigned to them, to simulate a real world data science work flow.
 ## Goal
 The ulimate goal of this application is to fully understand NLP in terms of Artificial Intelligence and create a succesful application that can demonstrate this. As the team of programmers conducts research to understand this data science application, there should be hard focus on thinking in terms of a data scienctist to fully understand that program and data being worked with. A programmers job is to make sure the application is built on time and ensure the application is what it is said be. The other important goal in this project is to fully understand how a team in the real world would create this project.

#### Important Goals:
- Understand NLP and how it will be used within the application.
- Work as a team to set deadlines and simulate a real world environment. This can be done through scrum meetings.
- Work with multiple NLP libraries to get a grasp on them and pick which ones would be most beneficial to the project.
- Test and document the application as much as possible.
- Demonstrate that the application is practical and could have real world use.
- Compare project to succesful NLP related applications, to ensure the programmers on the correct path. These checks will be performed every so often.
- Find data that will allow the application to be efficient.

 ## Objectives
- Learn about NLP techniques and libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, TextBlob, PyTorch and what advantages and disadvantages they each have.
- Create a bot that can sumarize long texts into a consise understandable format.
#### Key Objectives
##### Gather Data
- Collect data from corpuses, and other text collections tailored to our specific area that we want the model to be knowledgable on.
#### Text Preprocessing
- Preprocess the data, clean up the input, and remove all stopwords, unneeded punctuation, and unrelated things from the text.
##### Sumarization
- Train or create a model that can summarize preprocessed data to our specific needs.
##### UX/UI Design
- Design a user interface that will allow the application to be not only usable, but user friendly.
 ## Class and Block Diagram

 ## Contribution Plan
 #### Tyler Thompson
 - Help research useful NLP related techniques. Help problem solve and NLP related techniques we may run into.
 - Document the code properly and effectively.
 - Try and be more have a back end engineer for the project.

 ## Abstract
 Create a text summarizer that can take a body of text, and summarize a general understanding of the text. This application uses NLP to achieve this. For the initial planning phase of this application, research will be conducted by the development
 team, to gain knowledge on NLP and applications similar to this this one. The theory that each programmer understands, will be tested when it comes time to implement this application. Various libraries will need to be researched, and each
 one considered for the application should be useful in their own way. Each programmer will have various tasks assigned to them, to simulate a real world data science work flow.
